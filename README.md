# TDtoBlenderKeyframes

This project includes a python script and example files to help you create a keyframed animation in Blender using data from an AnimationCOMP created with TouchDesigner.

## Requirements:
* [Touchdesigner](https://derivative.ca/)
* [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)

## Limitations:
This project is meant as an example to get you started. You will need to know some python to tweak my script in order to apply the keyframes according to your needs. The code is unpolished, feel free to suggest improvements.

## Step by Step to reproduce the example:
* In TouchDesigner, export the keys tableDAT found within the animationCOMP to a .txt file.
* In Blender, open the python script, change the file path to open your keyframe data .txt file and run the script.
